This repo contains alot of files so let me explain flow of the project.

jupyter notebook:
It contains all the preprocessing and training of the models.
then we have saved each model in pickle file and used those files to deploye all three models to web app.


For web app I used streamlit.



Web URL: https://hate-speech-pred.herokuapp.com/ **


How to run locally:

if you want to run web app, just install modules specified in requirements.txt if you dont have it installed.

Then open comand prompt go to the project folder and then type **"streamlit run app.py"

Web app should be live and it will give you local ip on which you can access it.

jupyter notebook:

The notebook contains the initial code that I used to preprocess the data and train and evaluate models.
